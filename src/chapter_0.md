# Introduction
**Who is this book for?**

This book is intended for those who are new to the Rust programming language but not to programming in general. In other words, it is designed for programmers who already have experience in other languages and want to learn Rust. Overall, Rust is not the best choice as a first programming language for beginners. It's recommended to start with simpler languages like Python or TypeScript, then progress to languages such as Java or Go, and only after gaining a solid foundation, approach more complex languages like C/C++ or Rust.

**Idea and Concept of the Book:**

The essence of this book is that it is created with the help of Large Language Models (LLMs). The author formulates the requirements for each section, and the LLM generates the text and code examples. The author then edits and verifies the code through compilation and test execution. The edited version is added to the book. Typically, each chapter is divided by the author into sections, and each section is generated separately by the LLM, eventually being assembled into a full chapter from individual parts. This book is distributed under the MIT license, and pull requests from co-authors are welcome.
